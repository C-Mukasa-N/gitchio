This repository gathers all my projects and exercises created during my training in video game development.  
Here, you’ll find different games and prototypes designed to practice my skills and explore new techniques.

## Current Projects

- **Puissance3**: A puzzle game inspired by the classic "Connect 3," developed in Python with the pgzero library. This project was a personal challenge built after several training exercises.  
- **Mastermind**: A logic game where the player must guess a hidden color combination. Developed in Python with pgzero, this project demonstrates my programming and game design skills.  
- **A Banana Story**: An arcade game where the player controls an evil banana sliding through a glass store, causing destruction while collecting bonuses. Developed to get familiar with pgzero, collision handling, bonus systems, and progressive difficulty.  

## Upcoming Projects

More projects and exercises will be added to this repository as I continue my training.  
Each project will have its own folder and dedicated documentation explaining its concept, technical design, and development process.

### The Black Cat In Orange (in development)
**Genre:** Puzzle-adventure / Maze – Logic  
**Platform:** PC  
**Target Audience:** All ages, puzzle and logic game enthusiasts  

Inspired by Koh’s cube tests, this game puts the player in control of a black cat trying to escape a mysterious maze.  
- **Goal:** Reach the first door, then a second one, to complete the escape.  
- **Core mechanic:** The cat can only move on tiles of the same color as the starting one.  
- **Movement:** Controlled with the keyboard arrow keys.  
- **Footprints:** Paw prints appear on each cube to mark the path taken.  
- **Challenge:** Plan ahead and anticipate movements to avoid getting stuck.  
- **Level completion:** The level ends once both doors are reached in the correct order.  

A game that combines **exploration, logic, and anticipation**, with a minimalist aesthetic and an intriguing atmosphere.  

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, share my work, and build a portfolio of games and exercises that reflect my skills and growth as a game developer.
